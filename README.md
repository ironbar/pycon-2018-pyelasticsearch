# [Tutorial Prerequisites](/lessons/Lesson0_Prerequisites.md)
In this tutorial, you will be building a search engine to search for product attributes using a Flask app and Elasticsearch.

To participate in this tutorial, you need the following:

1) A computer with a good text editor (Vim, Sublime, Atom, etc.) installed on it.

2) Complete the [Tutorial Prerequisites](/lessons/Lesson0_Prerequisites.md)

# [Lesson 1](/lessons/Lesson1_Indexing.md)

Create the index

# [Lesson 2](/lessons/Lesson2_Searching.md)

The **term** query finds documents that contain the exact term specified in the inverted index. For instance:

The **match** query is of type boolean. It means that the text provided is analyzed and the analysis process constructs a boolean query from the provided text. The operator flag can be set to or or and to control the boolean clauses (defaults to or).
